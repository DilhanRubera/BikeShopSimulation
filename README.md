# Bike Shop Simulation 

## Overview

This project simulates a **bike shop system** using key Object-Oriented Software Engineering (OOSE) principles and design patterns. The system manages various bike shop operations such as inventory management, order processing, and customer interactions. It follows best practices in software design with a focus on code quality, maintainability, and extensibility.

### Key Features:
- **Inventory Management**: Tracks bikes and accessories available in the shop.
- **Order Processing**: Allows customers to place orders, manage payments, and track order statuses.
- **Customer Management**: Handles customer information, including their order history.
- **Design Patterns Used**:
  - **Factory Pattern**: For creating instances of various product types.
  - **Dependency Injection**: For managing class dependencies, making the system more flexible and testable.
  - **State Pattern**: For managing the dynamic state transitions of orders or products.
